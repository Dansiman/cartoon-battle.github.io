## Should I always save coins and buy cards in packs, 25 at a time, 50 at a time, to increase my odds?

No. This is not how the random generator works. A 10% drop rate will have the same results, regerdles whether you buy one 50k pack, or 50 1k packs, or 10 5k packs. There seems to be periods with increased drops altogether, you may want to try you luck then, but itâ€™s just a hunch. 

In other words, you can pull a legendary from a single-common-card pack:

## Should I buy the *special challenge card* or box packs?

> Final form cards, in general, are pretty good if you can fuse them to the same level as the majority of cards in your deck. Final form cards are equivalent to playing 2 cards at once. Box packs have higher potential, but are a roll of the dice.
